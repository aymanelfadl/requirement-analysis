# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a key phase in software development where we gather, analyze, and document the software requirements. This process helps to understand what the system should do, ensuring it aligns with user and business needs before development begins.

Requirement Elicitation – Collecting requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and workshops.

Requirement Documentation – Creating clear documents (e.g., use cases, specifications) to guide development.

Requirement Validation – Ensuring the gathered requirements are accurate and feasible by reviewing them with stakeholders.

Requirement Prioritization – Deciding which requirements are most important for the project’s success.

Requirement Management – Tracking and updating requirements as the project progresses.

Importance in SDLC:

Helps in aligning the development team and stakeholders, avoiding scope creep, and setting a clear project direction.
Provides the foundation for design, development, and testing phases, ensuring the system is built correctly.
Helps manage risks, allocate resources effectively, and meet deadlines.
Ultimately, it improves customer satisfaction by delivering a product that meets both user expectations and business goals.
