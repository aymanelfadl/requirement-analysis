# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a reference for the processes involved in Requirement Analysis for software development projects. It covers key activities such as requirement elicitation, documentation, validation, and prioritization.

# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a key phase in software development where we gather, analyze, and document the software requirements. This process helps to understand what the system should do, ensuring it aligns with user and business needs before development begins.

1. **Requirement Elicitation**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and workshops.

2. **Requirement Documentation**: Creating clear documents (e.g., use cases, specifications) to guide development.

3. **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring the gathered requirements are accurate and feasible by reviewing them with stakeholders.

4. **Requirement Prioritization**: Deciding which requirements are most important for the project’s success.

5. **Requirement Management**: Tracking and updating requirements as the project progresses.

### Importance in SDLC:

Helps in aligning the development team and stakeholders, avoiding scope creep, and setting a clear project direction.
Provides the foundation for design, development, and testing phases, ensuring the system is built correctly.
Helps manage risks, allocate resources effectively, and meet deadlines.
Ultimately, it improves customer satisfaction by delivering a product that meets both user expectations and business goals.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Aligns Stakeholders' Expectations:**  
   Requirement analysis helps ensure that both the development team and stakeholders are on the same page, minimizing misunderstandings and aligning everyone with the project goals.

2. **Prevents Scope Creep:**  
   By clearly defining and documenting requirements upfront, scope creep is minimized. This helps control the project and prevents unnecessary changes during development.

3. **Foundation for Development:**  
   It provides the blueprint for design and development, ensuring that the system built aligns with user needs and business objectives, resulting in a better-quality product.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting initial high-level requirements from stakeholders via interviews, surveys, and observations.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining and clarifying requirements through techniques like brainstorming and workshops.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating formal documents (use cases, specifications) to capture the system’s requirements.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing and modeling the requirements to identify gaps and ensure consistency.
- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing the requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are clear, feasible, and complete.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements specify what the system must do, describing features and functionalities. For a booking management project, examples include:
- **User Registration and Login:** Users should be able to register and log in to the system securely.
- **Property Search:** Users should be able to search for properties based on various filters (location, price, amenities).
- **Booking System:** Users should be able to select a property, check availability, and book it.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform. These are often related to system attributes such as performance, security, and scalability. For a booking management project, examples include:
- **Performance:** The system should be able to handle 500 concurrent users without degrading performance.
- **Security:** User data (e.g., personal details, payment info) should be encrypted using AES-256.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased demand during peak seasons.
